                <p id="mainText">When we began growing our own food in the Greenside Up garden, one of the 
                    early problems we encountered happened when we were trying to identify the ‘good’ 
                    wildlife from the ‘bad’. This was before the days of Google and we had no idea whether 
                    we were looking at friends or foe scampering across the plants and soil.It’s much easier
                    to check today, but to help you encourage beneficial insects and other creatures into
                    your garden, I’ve compiled a list of a dozen that might help you to ditch the chemicals 
                    for good and garden more sustainably.
